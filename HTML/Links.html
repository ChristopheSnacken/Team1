  <h1>How do you create a link using an url or a relative file path?</h1>
    <p>
      In HTML, the following link types indicate the relationship between two documents, <br>
      in which one links to the other using an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;area&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element.
    </p>
    <p> further down on the page you can find the list of the defined link types and their significance in HTML</p>
    <p>
      But one link type will be used a lot through all the websites.<br>
      And it goes like this for a URL:<br>
      <code>&lt;a href="URL"&gt; <i>"Displayed name of the link"</i> &lt;/a&gt;</code> <br>
      <br>
      For a relative path:<br>
      <code>&lt;a href="./FOLDER/FILE.TYPE"&gt; <i>"Displayed name of the link"</i> &lt;/a&gt;</code> <br>
      See the . in front of /?<br>
      By addind an extra dot (../) you can go back 1 folder in your file tree.

    </p>
