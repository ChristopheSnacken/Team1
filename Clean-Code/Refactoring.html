    <h1>REFACTORING</h1>
      <p>What is refactoring?: Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.</p>
      <p>Why should you do it?: Refactoring improves readability, complexity, maintainability and extensibility of the code.</p>
      <p>What is indentation? Indentation is a convention governing the indentation of blocks of code to convey program structure. </p>
      <p>Why should you use it?: Indenting helps better convey the structure of a program to human readers.</p>
      <p>How can you tell your code is DRY?: Don't repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions, or repetition of the same data, using data normalization to avoid redundancy. You can tell your code is DRY if you see exact same functions or data in different places inside your code.</p>
      <p>What is the reason to KISS?: KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" as a design principle. Because most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.</p>
      <p>What is separation of concerns?: Separation of concerns is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.</p>
