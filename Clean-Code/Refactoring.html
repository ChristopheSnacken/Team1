    <h1>WHAT IS CLEAN CODE?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean Code is for other programmers: Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers -you name it- all of that makes code sloppy and difficult to grasp.</li>
      <li>Clean Code doesn't contain duplication: Each time you have to make a change in a duplicate code, you have to remember to make the same change to every instance. This increases the cognitive load and slows down the progress.</li>
      <li>Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts: Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is less maintenance. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.</li>
      <li>Clean code passes all tests: You know your code is dirty when only 95% of your tests passed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>CAUSES OF UNCLEAN CODE</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Business pressure</li>
      <li>Lack of understanding of the consequences of technical debt</li>
      <li>Failing to combat the strict coherence of components</li>
      <li>Lack of tests</li>
      <li>Lack of documentation</li>
      <li>Lack of interaction between team members</li>
      <li>Long-term simultaneous development in several branches</li>
      <li>Delayed refactoring</li>
      <li>Lack of compliance monitoring</li>
      <li>Incompetence</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>REFACTORING</h1>
    <p>Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.</p>
    <p>The purpose of refactoring is improve readability, complexity, maintainability and extensibility of the code.</p>
    <p>Refactoring should be done as a series of small changes, each of which makes the existing code slightly better while still leaving the program in working order.</p>
    <p>The code should become cleaner.</p>
    <p>New functionality should not be created during refactoring.</p>
    <p>All existing tests must pass after refactoring.</p>
