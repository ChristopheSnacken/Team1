<h1> Design colors, text and images using CSS</h1>
<p>So how does it work?
  In this section it will become clear how to apply colours, text and images with CSS. First we have to think of what color and images to use exactly. Say we want to use a black background color or a white text color to the &lt;p&gt; element in HTML document. You would simply call it like so:

<br>p {
	background-color: black;
	text-color: white;
}
</br>

<br>You can assign values using the literal colorname (like ‘black’ in the example above), but also many other forms like hex-code, ems, rgb, rgba or even cm.</br>

<br>Images can be stylised by calling the img element in your CSS document. Using CSS you can define width, height and shape of your picture among other things.</br>

 <br>So you got a nice background, color for your text and an image. Now all that’s left is a proper font. You can also set this up using CSS. CSS has multiple different ways of manipulating the properties of the font you’re selecting. First of all you can set the font family by using the CSS property ‘font-family’. Say you want to use the standard Arial font for your &lt;p&gt; element, you simply just add the line ‘font-family: Arial’  and it will display all of the text within &lt;p&gt; with the font Arial. Likewise you can manipulate the style (font-style),  size (font-size) and weight (font-weight) of the font you selected.</br>

<br>The font-family property by default can only access fonts the standard fonts that are on your computer. Say you want to get a little bit more creative and have a different unique type of font for your site you can use google fonts. All fonts are free on this site. To use one in CSS you just select one of those fonts with the ‘+’ button and then click on your selection. Google will provide you with a piece of HTML and CSS-code. Copy this into your own files and you’re ready to go.
a relative file path to link up, meaning it’s referring to a local file inside the folder your .html file is located.  The second “rel”part tells  HTML you’re giving it a stylesheet, and finally “type” specifies the stylesheet as a CSS stylesheet.</br>
