The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level element.An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.The &lt;a&gt; element is an inline element.

      What values are possible for the option 'position'? What do they do?: There are five different position values:
        <ul>
          <li>static: An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page</li>
          <li>relative: An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
          <li>fixed: An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.</li>
          <li>absolute: An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).</li>
          <li>sticky: An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>How do you make an element stick to the top of the screen?: By making position property sticky</p>
