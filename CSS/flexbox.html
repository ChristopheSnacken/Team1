  <h1> What are flexboxes?</h1>

<p>The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities.
  <br>When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together</br>
  <br>When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.</br>

<br>Some important flex properties are:</br>
  <ul>
    <li>The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.</br>
    <li>The flex-direction specifies the direction of the flexible items.</br>
    <li>The flex-flow determines the entire flow of your box model and is a shorthand property for the above-mentioned properties: flex-direction flex-wrap.
  </ul>
